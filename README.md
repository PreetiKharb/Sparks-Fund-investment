# Sparks-Fund-investment
This a EDA project
Spark Funds wants to make investments in a few companies.
Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:
  1. It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
  2. It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in.
